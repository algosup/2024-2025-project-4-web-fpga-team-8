## 1. Audience

This document is primarily intended for developers who are interested in understanding how signals propagate inside an FPGA. It is also intended to provide a clear understanding of the technologies used and the design choices made in the development of the Web FPGA.

## 2. Project Overview
   
   The Web Interface for **FPGA Simulator** project aims to develop an interactive web-based educational tool that visualizes signal propagation inside an FPGA. The system will integrate a **2D FPGA floorplan** with dynamic signal simulation, allowing students to observe how electrical signals traverse FPGA components (BELs). Teachers will upload Verilog applications and testbenches, which the backend will process into a format suitable for visualization. The frontend will feature **zoom, pan, play, pause, step, and speed controls** to explore signal timing behavior. The backend will handle data conversion from **Verilog and SDF files** to ensure accurate simulation. The software will be open-source, with deliverables including source code, user documentation, and example applications (flip-flop & LUT4).

## 5. System Architecture

The system architecture will define how the software components interact to achieve the desired functionality. 

## 5.1. Frontend


### 5.1.1. FPGA Layout
The `FPGALayout` React component is responsible for rendering a 2D grid-based representation of the FPGA floorplan. This grid visually maps the Basic Elements (BELs) in a structured and interactive SVG element using D3.js.

#### üîß Purpose

This component builds a static 10√ó10 grid where each cell represents a BEL such as a LUT, flip-flop, or BRAM. It acts as the visual foundation on which dynamic simulation data (signal states, timing, routing) will later be overlaid.

#### üì¶ Implementation Summary

The core logic of the component includes:

- React Hooks:
  - `useRef`: Used to reference the `svg` DOM element directly.
  - `useEffect`: Ensures that D3 manipulations occur only after the SVG element has mounted.
- D3 Integration:
  - The SVG canvas is initialized with fixed dimensions (`500x500` pixels).
  - Nested loops (`cols` √ó `rows`) generate a grid of SVG `rect` elements, each sized at `50x50` pixels.
  - Each rectangle represents a BEL location, outlined with a black border and transparent fill.

#### üìê Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `rows`      | Number of horizontal cells (BEL rows)       |
| `cols`      | Number of vertical cells (BEL columns)      |
| `cellSize`  | Pixel size of each grid cell (width & height) |

#### üì§ Output

The resulting SVG displays a grid of 100 squares (10√ó10). This layout provides the base geometry for later enhancements, including:

- Coloring cells based on signal activity
- Overlaying routing paths
- Adding hover/click interactions for tooltips

### 5.1.2. File Selector
The FileSelector component allows the user to select from a list of available FPGA applications. It retrieves example files from the backend and displays them in a dropdown menu using Material UI components.

#### üîß Purpose

This component provides the user (typically a student or teacher) with a way to choose a pre-uploaded Verilog example for visualization. The selected file will then be passed to the simulation system for processing and rendering.

#### üì¶ Implementation Summary

- State Management:
  - `examples`: Holds the list of available example files retrieved from the backend.
  - `selectedFile`: Tracks the user's current selection.
- Backend Communication:
  - On initial load (`useEffect`), a `GET` request is sent to `/examples` to retrieve a list of available files from the backend server (`API_URL`).
- Material UI Components:
  - `Select`: A dropdown list showing file names.
  - `MenuItem`: Each file is rendered as an individual item.
  - `Typography` and `Container`: For layout and text formatting.
  
#### üåê API Endpoint

| Method | Endpoint   | Description                          |
|--------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/examples`  | Returns a list of example file names |

#### üí° UI Behavior

- The dropdown is initialized with a disabled placeholder (`"Select a file"`).
- File names are cleaned up using `.replace()` to remove suffixes like `_post_synthesis` and `.v` for better readability.
- The selected file name is stored internally, making it ready to trigger a new simulation/render.
#### üì§ Example File Name Cleanup

For readability, filenames like:

```
1ff_post_synthesis.v
```

...will be displayed as:
```
1ff
```
## 5.2. Backend

### 5.2.1. Backend - `app.py`

The backend is implemented using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework. It serves two main purposes:

1. **File Management**: Hosts and serves pre-generated Verilog/SDF files to the frontend.
2. **Data Endpoint**: Provides access to the list of available FPGA simulation examples.

The backend is designed to be simple, stateless, and file-based, avoiding any database dependency. It runs on `localhost:5000` by default and supports **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** to allow requests from the frontend.

#### üîß Key Features

- Lists available Verilog/SDF example files
- Serves raw simulation files by filename
- Flat file structure (no subfolders)
- Configurable upload directory (`/uploads`)

#### üóÇ Folder Configuration

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = "uploads"
app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"] = UPLOAD_FOLDER
```
All simulation files must be placed inside the uploads/ folder.

#### üîÑ Runtime

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `5000`
- Debug Mode: Enabled by default for development

#### üîê CORS

CORS is enabled to allow requests from the frontend development server (e.g. React‚Äôs localhost:5173).

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
```

### 5.2.2. File Parsing & Conversion

The backend includes a Verilog parser that extracts metadata from each `.v` file and generates a corresponding JSON representation. This JSON serves as a simplified **pivot format** to help the frontend understand which BELs are used and how signals are connected.

#### üîß Purpose

This parser analyzes Verilog modules to extract:

- Module name
- Input and output signals
- Logic signal assignments
- BEL type (e.g., Flip-Flop or LUT)

The goal is to convert structural HDL code into clean, frontend-usable metadata.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `parse_verilog()` function processes each Verilog file using **regular expressions** to extract relevant information. It is invoked on all `.v` files located in the `uploads/` directory and outputs corresponding `.json` files in `parsed_json/`.

#### üîç Parsing Features

- **Module Declaration**:
  - Extracts the module name and parameter list.
- **Signal Categorization**:
  - Detects `input`, `output`, and `logic` signals using pattern matching.
- **Signal Assignments**:
  - Recognizes both `assign` and `always` blocks for activity detection.
- **DUT Identification**:
  - Detects Device Under Test (DUT) ports, including implicit `.*` connections.
- **BEL Type Inference**:
  - Classifies the design as a Flip-Flop or LUT based on keywords and patterns.

#### üì§ Output Format (Example)

```json
{
  "module": "1ff",
  "inputs": ["clk", "D"],
  "outputs": ["Q"],
  "bel_type": "Flip-Flop"
}
```

#### üìÅ File Workflow

```
uploads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1ff.v
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2ffs.v
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

‚Üì Parsing step

parsed_json/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1ff.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2ffs.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### üß† BEL Type Detection Logic

| Condition                                              | Detected BEL Type |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Uses `DFF`, `NX_DFF`, or `always @(posedge ...)`       | Flip-Flop         |
| Uses `LUT_K`, `assign`, or logic expressions (`&`, `^`) | LUT               |
