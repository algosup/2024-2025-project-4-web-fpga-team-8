## 1. Overall Project Status Summary  

**Period:** 03/03/2025 - 07/03/2025  

Similar to the first week, project time was limited. However, we successfully held the **kick-off meeting on 06/03/2025**, where we discussed the project scope, objectives, and key deliverables.  

The drafting of key project documents has begun and is progressing well. The technical team has also started familiarizing themselves with the selected technologies. Moving forward, they will need to shift their focus towards the core development of the project.  

## 2. Milestones Met This Week  

- ✅ Kick-off meeting  

## 3. Timeline Status  

At this stage, it is difficult to accurately assess our position in the timeline due to the limited project time so far. Next week, as the team begins tackling initial development challenges, we will be better positioned to evaluate our progress and any potential risks to the schedule.  

## 4. Scope Status  

The project scope, as defined during the **kick-off meeting**, is documented in the **project charter**. However, given that we are still in the early stages, adjustments may be necessary as requirements become clearer.
