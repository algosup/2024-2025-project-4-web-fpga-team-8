## 1. Overall Project Status Summary  

**Period:** 17/03/2025 - 21/03/2025  

This week marked a strong advance in both documentation and development. The **review of the Functional Specification** was completed, and the team successfully defined and reviewed the **First Test Set**.  

Technically, major progress was made on the integration of frontend and backend components, with the **MVP layout grid now communicating with real data**. The pivot format structure was validated, and parser integration is nearing completion.

## 2. Milestones Met This Week  

- ✅ Second Test Set Completed  

## 3. Timeline Status  

The team remains aligned with the project timeline.  
The KPIs for Week 4 have been met or slightly exceeded in most areas. With the MVP integration taking shape and test architecture in place, the team is well-positioned to move into simulation playback and polishing tasks next week.

## 4. Scope Status  

The scope remains unchanged. The project is still operating within the MVP constraints outlined in the charter, and development tasks are being executed according to priority.  
No new features were added this week; instead, the team focused on strengthening existing core modules.
