## 1. Overall Project Status Summary  

**Period:** 24/03/2025 - 28/03/2025  

The fifth week marked the completion of the **Third and Final Test Set**, concluding the testing phase of the project.  
The team also reached a key technical milestone with the implementation of **basic simulation playback controls**, allowing signal data to be visualized across the FPGA layout.  

The Technical Specification was finalized and submitted, and backend data flow (Verilog + SDF → Pivot JSON) is now functional across the pipeline. As the MVP nears completion, attention is shifting toward refinements, edge case handling, and minor visual improvements.

## 2. Milestones Met This Week  

- ✅ Third and Final Test Set completed  
- ✅ Technical Specification v1.0 submitted  

## 3. Timeline Status  

The team remains on schedule. With core deliverables complete and integration stable, the focus for the final project week will be on **refinements, testing coverage, and final documentation**.  

## 4. Scope Status  

The MVP scope has been fully respected. No major deviations were introduced.  
Optional roadmap items (e.g., advanced animation effects, routing overlays) are being evaluated but remain secondary to final testing and cleanup.
