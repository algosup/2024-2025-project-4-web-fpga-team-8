## 1. Overall Project Status Summary

**Period:** 24/02/2025 - 28/02/2025  

The first week did not go as planned due to challenges related to absenteeism. Out of the six team members, only three were available throughout the week, as two members were absent, and one unexpectedly left the project without prior notice. As a result, we decided to postpone the initial meeting to the second week to ensure that all team members could be aligned.  

Despite these setbacks, the technical team began analyzing different technologies and exploring possible approaches to the project, aiming to bring well-informed ideas to the table during the upcoming meeting.
