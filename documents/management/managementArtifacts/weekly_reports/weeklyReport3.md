## 1. Overall Project Status Summary  

**Period:** 10/03/2025 - 14/03/2025  

The third week marked the **transition from planning to execution**. Several core development tasks were successfully initiated and in some cases finalized.  
In particular, **the Verilog parser reached an advanced implementation state**, and we made strong progress on frontend features including the **FPGA grid layout** and **file selection system**.

The team has begun populating the **KPI dashboard**, refining deliverables, and actively coordinating backend/frontend integration points.  

## 2. Milestones Met This Week  

- ✅ Functional Specification submitted
- ✅ First Test Set Completed

## 3. Timeline Status  

Progress is **aligned with the timeline**, with Week 3 KPIs largely achieved or close to completion.  
Some late-starting tasks like the SDF parser and simulation timeline are still in early stages, but this was expected per the project plan.

A detailed risk review has been scheduled for Week 4 to address potential blockers in signal visualization and parsing alignment.  

## 4. Absenteeism Report  

- **11/03:** **David CUAHONTE CUEVAS**  
- **13/03:** **Mariem ZAIANE**

## 5. Scope Status  

The scope remains consistent with the project charter and kickoff outcomes.  
The team is focusing on **foundational modules** (e.g., parsers, layout grid, API design) as planned.  
Any further UI or simulation complexity will be assessed after validating core file conversion flow.

## 8. Team Feedback  

The team has transitioned well into implementation, and synergy between members is growing.  
Some members suggested **prioritizing visual deliverables** (e.g., animation logic) earlier than scheduled to better evaluate feasibility.
